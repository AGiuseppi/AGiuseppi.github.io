## Theses Proposals

I have several open topics suitable for bachelord and master theses in any of the ongoing research projects that I list in the corresponding page. Since I do not update this website very often, students may send me an email to schedule an appointment.

To the interested (and determined) students, my research group could propose the possibility to do a master thesis in collaboration with a company (various industrial fields: space engineering, telecommunications, power systems).

### Short list of selected theses
To provide some examples to the students, here are listed a few selected theses for which I was the co-supervisor:

* Alessandro Santopaolo, "Forest fire prediction from satellite data using deep convolutional neural networks", grade: 110 cum laude and first place in the Telespazio Technology contest 2020 ([T-TeC 2020](https://www.telespazio.com/it/innovation/open-innovation/ttec-2020)). The thesis focused on the design of a short-term fire-risk predictor based on satellite-imaging analysis with convolutional neural networks.

* Lucrezia Della Torre, "AdaFed:  an adaptive performance-based framework for federated learning", grade: 110 cum laude and student honors for the Master in Control Engineering 2020. The thesis proposed a new algorithm for federated learning.

* Federico Kieffer, "Deep Neural Network for Personalized Medicine", grade: 110 cum laude and student honors for the Master in Control Engineering 2020. The thesis proposed a Model Predictive Control solution enhanced by deep neural networks for a personalised artificial pancreas.

* Lucrezia Terra, "A Model Predictive Control-based Heating System for Demand Response Programs in Smart Buildings", 110 cum laude. The thesis proposed an economic MPC based on Mixed-Integer-Programming for demand response programs in smart buildings.

* Gioacchino Manfredi, "Preventive-Controller Optimal Design for Critical Infrastructure Security", 110 cum laude. The student also received the award from Fondazione Sapienza reserved to the best students of the University that graduated in 2018. The thesis focused on developing an optimization tool to assure security standards in complex systems in compliance with the OSSTMM methodology.
