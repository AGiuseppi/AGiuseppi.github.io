## Ongoing Projects


### [EU/Korea H2020 5G-ALLSTAR](https://5g-allstar.eu/)

2018-2021, 5G-ALLSTAR (5G AgiLe and fLexible integration of SaTellite And cellulaR), H2020.EUK2018 (Eu-Korea) (RIA), GA ID: 815323, total funding for the EU side 2M€

The project, a joint EU-Korea action, aims at enabling seamless multi-connectivity between the 5G and the satellite Networks, by means of traffic-flow control for load balancing and spectrum sharing solutions.

I coordinated the Work-Package ``WP4 Multi-Connectivity'' responsible for the design and development of network controllers for the traffic-flow balancing problem in heterogeneous multi-RAT networks and the integration of satellite connections in the 5G framework. 
Personal research activities focused on the design and development of network control systems for dynamic load balancing in heterogeneous multi-RAT networks, based on Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory.

### ARIES

2020-2021, ARTES 4.0 ARIES (Advanced multi-Rat Integrated multi-sensors solution for Emergency prevention, detection and response operationS),  fundedby the European Space Agency (ESA) under GA ID: 4000133127, total funding 200k€

The project plans to provide the end users, i.e. the Municipality of L'Aquila/Abruzzo Region, and in particular the Italian Fire Brigades and the Regional Civil Protection Service, with an efficient service for prevention, monitoring and management of emergencies (fires, landslides, etc.) in the rural territory of L'Aquila.

I am serving as the technical coordinator of the project, overseeing the development of all of its technical and scientific results.
Personal research activities focused on the design of optimal sensor network placement and multi-connectivity algorithms for remote signaling during emergencies in 5G networks.


### [H2020 SESAME](http://http://sesame-h2020.eu)

2019-2022, H2020 SESAME (Smart European Space Access thru Modern Exploitation of Data Science), GA ID: 821875, total funding 3.3M€

The project aims at improving European launchers’ manufacturing and operations through Industry 4.0 solutions and Artificial Intelligence methods for automated logistics and Predictive Maintenance & Quality.

Personal research activities focus on the design and development of dynamic and adaptive optimization solutions for automatic operation management and predictive maintenance in spacecraft launch campaigns, based on Artificial Intelligence and Control Theory.

## Selected Completed Projects

### [H2020 ATENA](https://www.atena-h2020.eu)

2016-2019, H2020 ATENA (Advanced Tools to assEss and mitigate the criticality of ICT compoNents and their dependencies over Critical InfrAstructures), GA ID: 700581, total funding 8.1M€
    
The project focused on the protection of Critical Infrastructure, seen as Cyber-Physical Systems, covering all aspects of the Prevent-Detect-Mitigate paradigm for security. 

I coordinated the Work-Package ``WP3 IACS design for security'' responsible for the development of an optimal planner solution for the design of secure Cyber-Physical Systems, based on the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM), and the identification of the whole ATENA system requirements and architecture. 
Personal research activities focused also on the protection of Power Networks, by means of solutions based on Model Predictive Control and Robust Control Theory, for its efficient and resilient operation, even under ongoing Cyber-Physical Attacks.

### [FP7 T-NOVA](http://www.t-nova.eu)

2014-2016, FP7 T-Nova (Network Functions as-a-Service over Virtualised Infrastructures), GA ID: 619520, total funding 9.9M€

The project aimed at the design and implementation of a management/orchestration platform for the automated provision, configuration, monitoring and optimization of Virtualised Network Functions and Services over Virtualised Network/IT infrastructures. 

Personal research activities focused, starting from my master thesis in 2016, on the development of control solutions based on Reinforcement Learning for the optimal allocation of Virtualised Network Resources and on the design of load balancing algorithms in Software Defined Networks.
